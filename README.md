# Soccarena match court scraper

Based off the [Playwright Automation Starter](https://github.com/browsercat/playwright-automation-starter) repo by [BrowserCat](https://www.browsercat.com/).

## Getting Started

### 1. Install Your Dependencies

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm playwright install
```

### 2. Run Your Script Locally

Run the automation with the following:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

To tweak the behavior, edit `src/automate.ts`. And watch for changes with:

```bash
pnpm run dev:watch
```

### 3. Run Your Script in the Cloud

The starter is pre-configured to run your code on BrowserCat's infrastructure, then send the response back to your computer.

To enable this behavior, sign up for a [forever-free plan](https://app.browsercat.com/sign-up), then [create an API key](https://app.browsercat.com/keys).

Store the key in your `.env` file...

```bash
mv .env.default .env
```

```bash
BROWSERCAT_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
```

With your API key in place, you can run your commands in the cloud:

```bash
pnpm run dev:bcat
pnpm run dev:bcat:watch
```
